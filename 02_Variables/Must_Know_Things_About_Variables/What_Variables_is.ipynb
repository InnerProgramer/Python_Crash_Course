    "# **What Are Variables?**\n",
    "In both mathematics and programming, a variable is a symbolic name that holds a value. You can think of it as a labeled container that stores data such as a number, word, or other information. The main purpose of a variable is to store values so they can be reused and manipulated throughout a program or calculation without needing to rewrite them each time. Just like labeling a jar to know whatâ€™s inside, we assign a name to a value to make it easier to understand and use in our logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables make programs more readable and flexible. You can change the value of a variable at any time, and the rest of the code using that variable will automatically reflect the new value. Variable names should follow certain rules: they must begin with a letter or an underscore, can include letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number or include spaces or special symbols. In summary, variables are essential for storing and managing data efficiently in both math and programming."
