    "# **Avoiding Indentation Errors**\n",
    "Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related\n",
    "to the rest of the program. In the previous examples, the lines that printed\n",
    "messages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they\n",
    "were indented. Python’s use of indentation makes code very easy to read.\n",
    "Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code\n",
    "with a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice\n",
    "blocks of code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels\n",
    "help you gain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin to write code that relies on proper indentation, you’ll need to\n",
    "watch for a few common indentation errors. For example, people\n",
    "sometimes indent lines of code that don’t need to be indented or forget to\n",
    "indent lines that need to be indented. Seeing examples of these errors now\n",
    "will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do\n",
